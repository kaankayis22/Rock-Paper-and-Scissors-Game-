# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game-
STORY:
This rock paper scissors game is actually my first coding project... ever. Even though it isn't much; I really like seeing MY product. Something that I contributed into making. I see this as an outlet, where I can put MY thoughts, make MY design, and make MY version of something that has been made over millions of times.

What I learned:
Basic object-oriented programming concepts
the Python language
